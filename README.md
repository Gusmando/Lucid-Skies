# Lucid Skies

Lucid Skies is an open-world, third-person, action game with bullet-hell, platforming, and puzzle elements. The game takes place in the player's dream-state, transporting them to a foreign landscape filled with adventure in the hopes of gaining lucidity and facing their fear. The game was developed for Arizona State University's Computer Gaming Capstone class, where I served as a programmer collaborating with Jesus Franco Yescas, Caitlyn Huff, Liam Ivanic, and Kendry Johnson - this repository consists of the scripts developed by me for Lucid Skies.

### Post-Mortem
Project Lucid was the most ambitious project that I had worked on up until this point and now that it's over I must say that it was quite the endeavor. During developement, I personally focused my efforts on the UI, movement, inventory, combat, and saving game systems, designing and implementing each as needed. Given the short development time and ambitious nature of Lucid Skies, I often felt that developement was rushed, forcing the team to settle, but also simultaneously strengthening our experience with feature-priority and time management. Despite the short developement time, the team was able to deliver on the promises of the capstone- demonstrating the use of a database management system and delivering an interesting game around that feature. Ultimately, I'm extremely proud of the work that the team and I did on the project and I look forward to something even bigger and more complex in the future.
